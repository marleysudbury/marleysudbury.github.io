        <h1>Marley's Reading</h1>

        <p>
            A few months into 2023, it ocurred to me that I was hardly reading any books, despite having plenty of books to read and plenty of time in which to read them. To change this, I set myself a challenge to read 40 books by the end of the year. It was tough, but I managed it successfully. Going into 2024, I aimed my sights higher, at 52 books. I'm behind schedule currently, but I believe I will do it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have always been a reader, but it started to take a backseat in my life as I got older, especially when I went to univeristy. I am glad that I have been able to reverse that process, and also to increase the variety of reading material that I consume.

            A complete list of all the books I have read since I made a Goodreads account in 2023 can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/163692405?shelf=read">here</a>.

        <p>
            To make sure that I am keeping an adequate pace, I track my daily reading in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This allows me to share plots like those below which give a good indication of how my reading pace increases and decreases at different times through the year.
