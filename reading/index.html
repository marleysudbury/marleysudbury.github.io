            A few months into 2023, I decided that I wasn't reading enough. To
            change this, I set myself a challenge to read 40 books by the end
            of the year, alternating between fiction and non-fiction. Going
            into 2024, I aimed my sights higher, at 52 books.

            A complete list of all the books I have read since I made a
            Goodreads account in 2023 can be found <a href =

        <p>
            I track my daily reading in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This
            allows me to share plots like those below, which give a good
            indication of the variation in my reading pace.

        <p>
            In 2023, I challenged myself to read 40 books. I got off to a slow
            start, but then managed to catch up. To see a complete list of all
            the books I read that year, <a

        <h2 id="2024">2024 Challenge</h2>

        <p>
            In 2024, I challenged myself to read one book per week. My reading
            pace was inconsistent, until the last three months of the year.
            Perhaps this can be explained by <a

        <h2 id="2025">2025 (No) Challenge</h2>

        <p>
            After two years of reading challenges, in 2025 I decided to give
            them up. But I haven't given up reading! This year I am taking time
            to revisit books I read a long time ago, as well as sprinkling in
            some new ones in between. There is no arbitrary goal, and I am not
            trying to maintain a balance between fiction and non-fiction as I
            have done the previous two years. For a list of all books I have
            read so far, <a href=

        <h2 id="Thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

        <p>
            I have found that setting reading targets in terms of books per
            year or pages per day can be an effective motivator to increase
            time spent reading, especially when using spreadsheets and plots to
            visualise progress. However, at times it felt that reading was
            becoming a chore rather than a hobby.
        </p>

        <p>
           Going forward, I will hold on to the enjoyment of reading that I
           have fostered, and the desire to go out of my comfort zone when it
           comes to books. At the same time, I will be avoiding constraints and
           targest which might sap away some of that enjoyment. The spreadsheet
           will remain!
