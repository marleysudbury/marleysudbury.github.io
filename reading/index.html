        <h1>Marley's Reading</h1>

        <p>
            A few months into 2023, I decided that I wasn't reading enough. To change this, I set myself a challenge to read 40 books by the end of the year, alternating between fiction and non-fiction. Going into 2024, I aimed my sights higher, at 52 books. These challenges helped me rediscover the incredible entertainment and insight on offer in books both old and new.

            A complete list of all the books I have read since I made a Goodreads account in 2023 can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/163692405?shelf=read">here</a>.

            I track my daily reading in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This allows me to share plots like those below, which give a good indication of how my reading pace changes throughout the year.

            In 2023, I challenged myself to read 40 books. I got off to
            a slow start, but then managed to catch up. To see a

        <p>
        In 2024, I challenged myself to read one book per week. My reading pace was inconsistent, until the last three months of the year. Perhaps this can be explained by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/10/22/how-to-change-your-life-with-october-theory-by-a-psychologist/">"October Theory"</a>. To see a

        <h2 id="2025">2025 (No) Challenge</h2>

        <p>
            After two years of reading challenges, in 2025 I decided to give them up. But I haven't given up reading! This year I am taking time to revisit books I read a long time ago, as well as sprinkling in some new ones in between. There is no arbitrary goal, and I am not trying to maintain a balance between fiction and non-fiction as I have done the previous two years. For a list of all books I have read so far, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/163692405?date_added=2025&order=d&sort=date_read">click here</a>.
