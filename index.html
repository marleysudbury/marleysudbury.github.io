			Important question: what is the <em>best</em> text editor? Well, it depends on what you are doing&hellip; <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is good if you're on Windows, and <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> is really nice because it has the <em>Live Preview</em> mode for use with the Google Chrome browser. It is, in my opinion, a Dream Weaver killer, although I personally had to spend a long time customising it. Basically it comes down to lightweight vs. functionality. Take your pick, as long as you don't pick <a href="sublime.jpg">Sublime</a>, like, I would totally rather you used Vim than that garbage. IDEs? Ain't nobody got time for that.

            If you're having trouble learning a language, I find it helps to learn loads of useless stuff, like "Où est le singe? Le singe est dans l'arbre!" (Where is the monkey? The monkey is in the tree!). Also "Wo ist das Krankenhaus? Meine Frau ist krank!" (Where is the hospital? My wife is sick!). These stick with you, and are very easily adaptable. Also note how all nouns are capitalised in German, not just the proper ones, which can be <em>confusing</em>. It should also be noted that all of this was terrible advice, apart from maybe the last bit&hellip;

            What is the most popular HTML tag used on this website? I would imagine that it is &lt;p> (paragraph), followed by &lt;em> (emphasis, <em>which I do an awful lot of</em>).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Does this website count as a portfolio? I would like to say so, but I feel that it really doesn't reflect the skills I possess which could actually be applied in a real life employment scenario.

			Mac vs. PC: Well, I own both, so I don't have a massive amount of preference either way. Working on a PC is easier because, contrary to popular belief, they have a far greater tendency to 'just work'. A Mac, with a small number of choice apps and files, works just fine, but there is a significantly smaller selection of things you can do.

			About this website (as if anybody cares): All pages are HTML, styling done primarily with external CSS files, all scripting is JS, everything written by me, unless stated otherwise and hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>.

            I've been listening to a lot of Simon &amp; Garfunkel recently, so I thought I would put this here, just to pass on the bug:
        </p>
        
        <p class="centred">
            <iframe src="//tools.applemusic.com/embed/v1/album/290508326?country=gb" height="500px" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I should stress that my personal Simon &amp; Garfunkel collection is much larger than this. And yes, I use Apple Music, fight me bitch.
