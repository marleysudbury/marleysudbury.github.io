			Anybody looking for an image host? I have decided I quite like
			"<a href="http://tinyimg.io/">tinyimg.io</a>". They let you host
			stuff like <a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/STKOukL.PNG">this</a>!

			Important question: what is the <em>best</em> text editor? Well, it depends on what you are doing... <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is good if you're on Windows, and <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> is really nice because it has the <em>Live Preview</em> mode for use with the Google Chrome browser. It is, in my opinion, a Dream Weaver killer, although I personally had to spend a long time customising it. Basically it comes down to lightweight vs. functionality. Take your pick, as long as you dont pick <a href="sublime.jpg">Sublime</a>, like, I would totally rather you used VIM than that garbarge. IDEs? Ain't nobody got time for that. Unless it's C.

			Mac vs. PC: Well, I own both, so I don't have a massive amount of preference either way. Working on a PC is easier because, contrary to popular belief, they have a far greater tedency to 'just work'. A Mac, with a small number of choice apps and files, works just fine, but there is a significantly smaller selection of things you can do.
