				<h1>1. Sorting algorithms in Python</h1>
				
				<p>
					Important things to explain: Python is an interprative 
					programming language, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm
					which sorts elements in a list or array. I'm using python
					because it is a pretty good language for these sorts of
					things, in my opinion. I'm sure that you'll be able to
					implement these and other sorting algorithms in whatever
					language you want, so go do that.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
				
				<p>
					One of the least efficient sorting algorithms, but a good
					place for begginers, the bubble sort is a sorting algorithm
					which I believe every good programmer should have memorised.
					It works by going through the list and comparing each pair,
					swapping if the one on the left is larger than the one on
					the right, until there are no more swaps to make.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The pseudo code for a bubble sort function would be like so:
<pre>
function bubSort(alist):
	swapped = true;
	while (swapped):
		swapped = false;
		for (i = 0 to len(alist) - 1):
			if (alist[i] > alist[i+1]):
				temp = alist[i];
				alist[i] = alist[i+1];
				alist[i+1] = temp;
				swapped = true;
	return alist;
</pre>
					This can be translated into the following python code:
<pre>
def bubSort(alist):
	swapped = True
	while (swapped):
		swapped = False
		for i in range(0, len(alist) - 1):
			if (alist[i] > alist[i+1]):
				temp = alist[i]
				alist[i] = alist[i+1]
				alist[i+1] = temp
				swapped = True
	return alist
</pre>
					Which really isn't that different to the pseudocode, hmm.
					When this function is given an unordered list, it orders
					them, just like you would expect, but it isn't very pretty,
					and it can be difficult to see how it works. Solution?:
<pre>
def bubSort(alist):
	print(alist)
	swapped = True
	while (swapped):
		swapped = False
		for i in range(0, len(alist) - 1):
			if (alist[i] > alist[i+1]):
				temp = alist[i]
				alist[i] = alist[i+1]
				alist[i+1] = temp
				swapped = True
				print(alist)
	return alist
</pre>
					Yes, there are only two more lines. Example output:
<pre>
[5, 3, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
[3, 4, 2, 5, 1]
[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</pre>
					Much prettier in my opinion, although this is perhaps now
					more suited to a procedure than a function. Due
					to the fact that it retains the return instruction, it is
					still a function.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
				
				<p>
					As mentioned, the bubble sort is a fairly inefficient
					sorting algorithm. A slightly better one is the insertion
					sort, which works by comparing the next number in the
					unsorted list to each one in the sorted list until you find
					the right location for it. It is a bit like an inside out
					bubble sort.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The pseudocode for an insertion sort function would be thus:
<pre>
function insSort(alist):
	for (i = 1 to len(alist)):
		cnt = i;
		while (alist[cnt] < alist[cnt - 1]):
			temp = alist[cnt];
			alist[cnt] = alist[cnt - 1];
			alist[cnt - 1] = temp;
			cnt--;
	return alist;
</pre>
					Already two lines shorter than the bubble sort! Actual
					python script:
<pre>
def insSort(alist):
	for i in range(1, len(alist)):
		cnt = i
		while (alist[cnt] < alist[cnt - 1] and cnt > 0):
			temp = alist[cnt]
			alist[cnt] = alist[cnt - 1]
			alist[cnt - 1] = temp
			cnt -= 1
	return alist
</pre>
					Again, remarkably similar to the pseudocode. Similar to
					last time, it is quite difficult to visualise the
					sorting process which is actually going on here, but:
<pre>
def insSort(alist):
	print(alist)
	for i in range(1, len(alist)):
		cnt = i
		while (alist[cnt] < alist[cnt - 1] and cnt > 0):
			temp = alist[cnt]
			alist[cnt] = alist[cnt - 1]
			alist[cnt - 1] = temp
			cnt -= 1
		print(alist)
	return alist
</pre>
					Two more lines is enough to give us a nice idea of what
					is happening. Example output:
<pre>
[5, 3, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</pre>
					BTW, that is half as many steps as the bubble sort, for
					the same data set. There are many other sorting
					algorithms, but I don't know how to implement them off
					the top of my head. (<-- A stack(LIFO) reference)
				</p>
					
				<p>
					P.S. I made a codepen for this. Yes, I know that codepen
					is for front-end web development, but I don't think
					there are any rules against this sort of thing. Anyway:
					<a href =
					"https://codepen.io/marleysudbury/pen/OgVyyO">
					link</a>. Also, if you want the programs in python, but
					can't be bothered to copy and paste it download these:
					<a href = "python/bubSort.py">bubSort.py</a> & <a href
					= "python/insSort.py">insSort.py</a>. As I mentioned, if
					you are programming-savvy, as I suspect you are if you
					are still reading, have a go at implementing some other
					sorting algorithms. Check <a href =
					"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Popular
					_sorting_algorithms">here</a> if you need some
					inspiration.

					It is no great secret that Adobe Photoshop is probably my favourite computer program. I personally favour CS6, but whatevs. Here are my top tips for being a Photoshop whizzkid.

				<h3>Blending modes</h3>
				<p>
					Quite a vague topic, I know, but blending modes are useful more often than not, so it is worth getting to grips with them. Different blending modes are useful depending on the content of your layers and the desired final effect. The most applicable is 'Screen', which makes a part of the image more transparent based upond its lightness value, i.e. a completely dark area will have 0% transparency.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					<img src = "screen.jpg" width = 50%><br>
					The darker areas, i.e. those with shadows, are more transparent than the areas where light is hitting.

					1 (Dawe): Senator Collins, thanks for coming in.<br>
					2 (Clarke): It's a great pleasure, thank you.<br>
					1: This ship that was involved in the incident off western Australia this week,<br>
					2: Yeah, the one the front fell off?<br>
					1: Yeah.<br>
					2: Yeah, that's not very typical, I'd like to make that point.<br>
					1: Well, how is it untypical?<br>
					2: Well, there are a lot of these ships going around the world all the time, and very seldom does anything like this happen. I just don't want people thinking that tankers aren't safe.<br>
					1: Was this tanker safe?<br>
					2: Well, I was thinking more about the other ones.<br>
					1: The ones that are safe?<br>
					2: Yeah, the ones that the front doesn't fall off.<br>
					1: Well if this wasn't safe, why did it have eighty-thousand tonnes of oil on it?<br>
					2: Well, I'm not saying it wasn't safe, it's just perhaps not quite as safe as some of the other ones.<br>
					1: Why?<br>
					2: Well, some of them are built so the front doesn't fall of at all.<br>
					1: Wasn't this built so the front wouldn't fall off?<br>
					2: Well, obviously not.<br>
					1: How do you know?<br>
					2: Well, 'cause the front fell off, and twenty-thousand tonnes of crude oil spilled into the sea caught fire, it's a bit of a give away. I'd just like to make the point that that is not normal.<br>
					1: Well, what sort of standards are these oil tankers built to?<br>
					2: Oh, very rigorous, maritime engineering standards.<br>
					1: What sort of thing?<br>
					2: Well, the front's not supposed to fall off, for a start.<br>
					1: And what other things?<br>
					2: Well, there are regulations governing the materials that they can be made of.<br>
					1: What materials?<br>
					2: Well, cardboards out.<br>
					1: And?<br>
					2: No cardboard derivatives.<br>
					1: Like, paper?<br>
					2: No paper, no string, no cellotape.<br>
					1: Rubber?<br>
					2: No, rubbers out. They've got to have a steering wheel, there's a minimum crew requirement.<br>
					1: What's the minimum crew?<br>
					2: Oh, one I suppose.<br>
					1: So the allegations that they're just designed to carry as much oil as possible, and to hell with the consequences, I mean that's ludicrous is it?<br>
					2: Oh ludicrous! Absolutely ludicrous, these are very, very strong vessels.<br>
					1: So what happended to it in this case?<br>
					2: Well, the front fell off in this case by all means, but it's very unusual.<br>
					1: But, Senator Collins, why did the front fall off?<br>
					2: Well, a wave hit it.<br>
					1: A wave hit it?<br>
					2: A wave hit the ship.<br>
					1: Is that unusual?<br>
					2: Oh yeah, at sea? Chance in a million.<br>
					1: So what do you do to protect the environment in cases like this?<br>
					2: Well, the ship was towed outside the environment.<br>
					1: Into another environment?<br>
					2: No, no, no, it's been towed beyond the environment.<br>
					1: No, but from one environment into another environment.<br>
					2: No, it's beyond the environment, it's not in an environment, it's been towed beyond the environment.<br>
					1: It must be somewhere. Well, what's out there?<br>
					2: Nothing's out there.<br>
					1: Well, there must be something out there.<br>
					2: There is nothing out there. All there is is sea, and birds, and fish.<br>
					1: And?<br>
					2: And twenty-thousand tonnes of crude oil.<br>
					1: And what else?<br>
					2: And a fire.<br>
					1: And, anything else?<br>
					2: And the part of the ship that the front fell off, but there's nothing else out there.<br>
					1: Senator Collins, thank's for joining us.<br>
					2: It's a complete void.<br>
					1: Yeah, we're out of time.<br>
					2: The environment's perfectly safe. We're out of time?<br>
					1: Yeah.<br>
					2: Can you book me a cab?<br>
					1: But didn't you come in a Commonwealth car?<br>
					2: Yes, I did.<br>
					1: What happened?<br>
					2: Well, the front fell off.
