			A (short) story (about <a href="courgette.jpg">magic courgettes</a>, bits in <red>red</red> are edited, original <a href="story.jpg">here</a>):
		</p>
		<div class="infringe">
			<p>
				Long, long ago<red>,</red> in a land full of wonderful history<red>,</red> a wise farmer owned a grand <red>field</red> of rare <red>courgettes, which</red> he would not give away. These <red>courgettes</red> were no ordinary vegetables, whenever you ate them, they made you stronger than a wrestling rhino.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sneaking around like a spy under cover<red>,</red> the grand Imperial guards overheard the <red>distressed</red> Emperor pleading for the rare and wonderful <red>courgettes</red>. Wishing for great strength, the Emperor trudged angrily out of his room.
			</p>
			<p>
				After hearing the Emperor's private thoughts<red>,</red> the two insane <red>Imperial</red> guards crept out of the golden temple and stole the precious courgettes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The frustrated Emperor was so furious that he ran like a rocket to the <red>farmer's</red> wooden house<red>, begging</red> for forgiveness<red>.</red>
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why forgiveness is important and stealing is wrong. <sup><em><red>Why, because the Emperor says so?</red></em></sup>
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			I wrote this story in primary school, but I can't remember at what age. In case you're wondering, a courgette is the proper name for a 'zucchini', and no, I don't believe I have ever eaten one. Also my handwriting has only gotten slightly better since, hence why this website is typed.
