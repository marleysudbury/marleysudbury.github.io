			A (short) story (about <a href="courgette.jpg">magic courgettes</a>, bits in <red>red</red> are edited, original <a href="story.jpg">here</a>):
		</p>
		<div class="infringe">
			<p>
				Long, long ago<red>,</red> in a land full of wonderful history<red>,</red> a wise farmer owned a grand <red>field</red> of rare <red>courgettes, which</red> he would not give away. These <red>courgettes</red> were no ordinary vegetables, whenever you ate them, they made you stronger than a wrestling rhino.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sneaking around like a spy under cover<red>,</red> the grand Imperial guards overheard the <red>distressed</red> Emperor pleading for the rare and wonderful <red>courgettes</red>. Wishing for great strength, the Emperor trudged angrily out of his room.
			</p>
			<p>
				After hearing the Emperor's private thoughts<red>,</red> the two insane <red>Imperial</red> guards crept out of the golden temple and stole the precious courgettes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The frustrated Emperor was so furious that he ran like a rocket to the <red>farmer's</red> wooden house<red>, begging</red> for forgiveness<red>.</red>
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why forgiveness is important and stealing is wrong. <sup><em><red>Why, because the Emperor says so?</red></em></sup>
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			I wrote this story in primary school, but I can't remember at what age. In case you're wondering, a courgette is the proper name for a 'zucchini', and no, I don't believe I have ever eaten one.

			I saw a video today made by <em>Vice</em>. It was about a "non-binary", "queer"<sup><em>How?</em></sup>, disabled<sup><em>Obviously.</em></sup> sex-worker. It would not be a stretch to say that I currently have very little faith left in humanity. Apparently she has lost lots of clients because she refuses to fit into the "role" of a "she". I am not a religious man, but I find myself turing to the old phrase, "Y'all need Jesus". <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbpmj3Zehhw">Here is a video which does a good job summing it up</a>. Charming fella', check out his other stuff.

			I think that most people can agree that the 'number of genders' lies somewhere between 2 and &infin;. In-fact, I would go so far as to say that it <em>must</em> be one of those. Either 'gender' is to be comprised of 'man' and 'woman', or it is entirely pointless, and everyone is completely able to interpret the matter in their own way (it's the second one).

			Do you know what I find annoying? When you click on something to open it, and then click it again to close it, but instead of closing it just opens again. Looking at you, YouTube and iTunes.

			Important question: what is the <em>best</em> text editor? Well, it depends on what you are doing&hellip; <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is good if you're on Windows, and <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> is really nice because it has the <em>Live Preview</em> mode for use with the Google Chrome browser. It is, in my opinion, a Dream Weaver killer, although I personally had to spend a long time customising it. Basically it comes down to lightweight vs. functionality. Take your pick, as long as you don't pick <a href="sublime.jpg">Sublime</a>, like, I would totally rather you used Vim than that garbage. IDEs? Ain't nobody got time for that.

            If you're having trouble learning a language, I find it helps to learn loads of useless stuff, like "Où est le singe? Le singe est dans l'arbre!" (Where is the monkey? The monkey is in the tree!). Also "Wo ist das Krankenhaus? Meine Frau ist krank!" (Where is the hospital? My wife is sick!). These stick with you, and are very easily adaptable. Also note how all nouns are capitalised in German, not just the proper ones, which can be <em>confusing</em>. It should also be noted that all of this was terrible advice, apart from maybe the last bit&hellip;

            What is the most popular HTML tag used on this website? I would imagine that it is &lt;p> (paragraph), followed by &lt;em> (emphasis, <em>which I do an awful lot of</em>).

            Does this website count as a portfolio? I would like to say so, but I feel that it really doesn't reflect the skills I possess which could actually be applied in a real life employment scenario.

			Mac vs. PC: Well, I own both, so I don't have a massive amount of preference either way. Working on a PC is easier because, contrary to popular belief, they have a far greater tendency to 'just work'. A Mac, with a small number of choice apps and files, works just fine, but there is a significantly smaller selection of things you can do.

            I've been listening to a lot of Simon &amp; Garfunkel recently, so I thought I would put this here, just to pass on the bug:
        </p>
        
        <p class="centred">
            <iframe src="//tools.applemusic.com/embed/v1/album/290508326?country=gb" height="500px" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I should stress that my personal Simon &amp; Garfunkel collection is much larger than this. And yes, I use Apple Music, fight me bitch.
