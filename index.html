                    "Marley impressed me with his programming project&hellip; Of particular merit in the work was
                    Marley's use of recusion. An advanced technique that most students shy away from, largely because
                    most don't understand it, but that was the best way to solve the problem and Marley created some
                    impressive code as a result."—A level teacher
