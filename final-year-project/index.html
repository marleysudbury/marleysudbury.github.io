        Individual project worth 40 credits as part of my final year studying BSc Computer Science at Cardiff
        University.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>
            To track the spread of a tumour, pathologists examine lymph nodes in the surrounding area for metastatic
            growths. This
            is done by looking at high resolution scans of slides with tissue taken from the lymph nodes. Deep learning
            systems have
            demonstrated a great ability to classify images, and so researchers have looked at applying these techniques
            to the
            problem of tissue classification, including lymph node classification, with the aim of creating a system
            which can aid
            pathologists. In this project a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to evaluate two methods for
            classifying
            lymph nodes: a whole-slide method, which uses a down scaled version of the entire slide image as its input,
            and a
            patch-based method which takes small patches of the image as the input. The effects of data augmentation and
            stain
            normalisation were also investigated. Two datasets were used in this project, with one provided by the Head
            and Neck
            5000 Study, and the other being the Camleyon16 training dataset. The best performance obtained from the
            whole-slide
            method was an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.727, with a false positive
            rate (FPR) of
            0.36 and a false negative rate (FNR) of 0.22. The patch-based method gave an AUC of 0.890, with an FPR of
            0.21 and FNR
            of 0.24. This level of performance falls slightly short of the state of the art, and suggestions are
            provided for why
            this is and how it can be improved in future.
