On Thursday 23rd of June 2016, the citizens of the United Kingdom voted in a referendum on their membership of the European Union. The results were as such: 51.9% voted to leave, while 49.1% voted to remain, with a turnout of 72.21%.
</p>
<p>
They were asked to choose between "Remain a member of the European Union" or "Leave the European Union". The decision to leave the EU has been coloquially termed "Brexit" with remain taking the less catchy "Bremain".
</p>
<p>
As a result of this referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron, who campaigned to remain in the EU, has announced his intention to resign. It's no great loss. The issue with leaving the European Union on this result is that it allows a decision to be made against the beliefs of the majority of the British public. What I mean by this is that the difference was less than 2%, which is a tiny margin on which to place such a massive decision. Even with a higher turnout, it would seem foolish to change something that half the population don't want to change. But with a turnout of 72% (quite high compared to other elections) there is more of a reason not to leave. Those who didn't vote did so for many reasons, but one reason may be that they couldn't decide one way or the other, which is understandable as both sides made convincing arguments. However I feel that if no decision can be made, then surely the best decision is just to stay in, until you have made your mind up one way or the other. This means that there is a possibility more than half of the British public would wish for a remain vote.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of this result, change will be slow at best, as even the pro <i>Brexit</i> politicians are urging a slow pace, whilst the EU themselves want to disentangle with haste. Another issue with this result is the differences between different areas of the UK. England and Wales narrowly voted to leave, whilst both Scotland and N. Ireland voted in favour of remaining. This has not helped political tensions between Scotland and England, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon calling for a second independance referendum, which if granted risks destroying the union of Britain.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I feel that the future of diplomacy is international unions. I will not deny the numerous and serious short-comings of the EU as it is, but I also feel that we will need to be part of something like it if we are to remain a serious international power. There is a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215">petition</a> on the parliament website asking for a second referendum based on the requirement of more than 60% of votes going to one side.
</p>
<p>
I don't feel that either vote will permenantly ruin our country, but I think that leaving the EU could have regretful consequences. Ultimatley, unions aren't meant to last forever, and 43 years isn't bad, but we must not turn our backs on Europe, lest we forget why we started it to begin with, to counter extreme nationalism, which is making a comeback.
</p>

			Edit (2017-07-03): I have finally, at long last, accepted the result, partly as the EU showed again its absolute idiocy by fining Google... For advertising their own products. WTF? As if we needed any further evidence that they have no clue what on Earth they are doing. Not that I think anybody in this country knows any better. I would feel much more comfortable with Corbyn in charge, but May is what we've got, so best be thankful for that.
