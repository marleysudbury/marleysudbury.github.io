    <p>
      What makes up this web page? Primarily a HTML file, called "index.html", which is in the directory "28-01-17-anatomy". This contains all the text of the website, such as this text. However the file also links to other files on the server. For example, the style of the page comes from a file called "stylesheet.css", which is linked to by almost all the HTML files on the site. There is some styling in this file itself. The background colour of this page is different to the one declared by the CSS file. This is to try and give the different pages their own personality and identity. Another item linked to by this file is the "favicon", which is again linked to most of the files.

    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>
      A .html file can be created and altered in any text editor, even notepad. It should start with &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. This itself is not HTML, but an instruction to the browser that the file it's processing is a HTML file. If your page isn't behaving in the expected way, this is one of many possible causes.
