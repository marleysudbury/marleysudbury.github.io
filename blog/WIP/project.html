        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
            In September 2018 I began my undergraduate degree at Cardiff University. The course title is <em>Computer
                Science With a Year in Industry</em>. The Year in Industry or Placement fits neatly between second year
            and final year. I was in the middle of submitting applications for placements when the Coronavirus pandemic
            began. This nearly caused me to give up on the idea of a placement, but in the end I stuck with
            it.
        </p>

        <h2>National Star</h2>

        <p>
            National Star is a charitable organisation which provides education for young people with complex
            disabilities, and is based primarily in Cheltenham, England. Their IT department offer two placements for
            univesity students: IT Service Desk Engineer, and Software Developer. The latter is more my kind of thing,
            but that role was already filled by the time I applied, so I went for the Service Desk job. After submitting
            the application and having an interview with the IT Manager, I was offered the placement and accepted.
        </p>

        <p>
            After I accepted the position, I had to undergo a DBS background check to ensure that I was suitable to work
            in an education environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            My placement began on 07/09/2020, and after an induction week of mandatory training, I began learning on the
            job. Here is a brief summary of my responsibilities:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support#Tier_1">first-line IT support</a>
                over the phone or by email.</li>
            <li>Installations or moves of computers, peripherals and telephones.</li>
            <li>Maintain the IT equipment inventory.</li>
            <li>Produce, maintain and organise knowledge base articles, procedures and diagrams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflective report</h2>

        <p>
            During the placement year, I have only two assignments for the university. The main one of these is the
            reflective report, which makes up 90% of the placement year's contribution to the degree. The placement year
            itself is worth 10% of the degree, although I assume this varies from institution to institution.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is not the first reflective report I have had to write, as they have been a part of several previous
            coursework assignments. However, this is the one which has the biggest influence on my degree (ignoring that
            the final year project will have a much higher influence).
        </p>

        <h2>Fun!</h2>

        <p>
            Girls just want to have fun. It's in a song, so it must be true. Here are some things I enjoyed during my
            placement:
        </p>

        <p>
            Playing around with computer hardware! There were pleanty of battery replacements, RAM installations and
            storage swaps with laptops and desktops of various form factors. Not all my operations were successful, but
            it was great to get hands on with technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            PowerShell! I don't think I had ever used PowerShell before this job, but I quickly discovered how useful it
            could be. Throughout my placement, I wrote several PowerShell scripts for purposes such as removing local
            user profiles from a workstation, moving workstations into a different organisational unit (OU) in Active
            Directory (AD) and getting a list of emails from a list of user's names.
        </p>

        <h2>Beyond technology</h2>

        <p>
            Going beyond the technical experiences and skills, there is another dimension to consider. Throughout the
            placement I have developed skills which you might call 'transferable skills', or 'employability skills', or
            'soft skills', or 'people skills'. Skills such as communication. This comes naturally when your daily
            experience involves talking to many people, most of whom you don't know, and helping resolve their issues.
            It also comes about through collaboration with the team and department.
