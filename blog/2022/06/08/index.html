        <h2>Dithering</h2>

        <p>
            The first step in the process was to apply dithering to the image so that it could approximate greyscale
            whilst consisting of only black and white pixels. The dithering algorithm used is called <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Steinberg_dithering">Floyd–Steinberg dithering</a>.
            This method works by thresholding each pixel and offsetting the error from that threshold onto its
            neighbours.
        </p>

        <!--Colour-->
        <!--Black and white-->
        <!--Threshold-->
        <!--Dithered-->

        <p>
            Once both the start and finish images have been dithered, we can count the number of black pixels in each,
            and create a number of particle objects equal to the number of black pixels in the image with the most black
            pixels.

        <h2 id="p5js">Javascript implementation</h2>

        <p>
            Although this program was initially implemented in the Processing library for Java, a p5.js implementation
            was also made which allows this process to be performed in the browser.
