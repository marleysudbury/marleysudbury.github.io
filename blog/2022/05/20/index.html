            That's a hard word to spell. Today I was looking ahead in my calendar to get a feel for how busy the next
            few months would be. Whilst doing so, I saw an entry that was utterly incomprehensible.
        </p>

            <img width="100%" src="1_calendar.png"
                alt="Event in an Apple calendar on the sixth of August 2022 which reads: Sequence date, Date taken from integer 16 in my Sequence (6, 96)">

        <p>
            My initial reaction to this was that Siri must have listened to me discussing programming with someone, and
            mistaken it for an instruction to create an event. However, that answer didn't sit right with me. The words
            were too well formed. If you want to work it out yourself, this is your last chance.
        </p>

        <h2>Glimmer of recognition</h2>

        <p>
            The word <em>Sequence</em> stirred something deep within me. I recall that at some point I was quite fond of
            taking pairs of numbers and turning them into a sequence like the Fibonacci sequence. And since here there
            was a pair of numbers, that seemed like a sensible place to start.
        </p>

        <p>
            I put together a quick Python program to do the calculations for me.
        </p>

        <figure width="10%">
            <code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap;">
a = 6
b = 96
for i in range(0, 16):
    print(a)
    nth = a + b
    a = b
    b = nth
            </code>
            <figcaption>
                The code I whipped together.

        </figure>

        <p>
            When run, lo and behold:
        </p>

        <figure>
            <code style="display: block; white-space: break-spaces;">

60822
            </code>
            <figcaption>
                And here's the answer.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The sixteenth integer in the sequence is quite clearly 60822, which can be interpreted as 06/08/2022.
            However, this doesn't answer all of the questions.
        </p>

        <h2>Memory Blank</h2>

        <p>
            I have no recollection of this particular sequence, nor of the significance of its starting pair. I also
            don't remember adding this to my calendar. Luckily, at least on that last point there is some evidence left
            behind. By examining the .ics file in a text editor, we can see the date on which it was created.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="2_date.png"
                alt="The secret metadata hidden within the calendar file. The line highlighted reads CREATED:20170517T142214Z">
            <figcaption>
                The event was created on 17/05/2017, which feels like at least two lifetimes ago.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Here though, the trail goes cold. Will something strange happen on that day? Probably. Will I ever
            understand the significance of those number or the sequence they generate? Probably not. When I checked my
            camera roll for 17/05/2017 I found two photographs of fidget spinners and the SCP logo. I was going to put a
            link to the logo but apparently the SCP wiki and all wikis hosted on Wikidot have been taken down by
            hackers.
