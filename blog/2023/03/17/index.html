        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

        <p>
            The inspiration for this project is a poster of Barack Obama, designed by Shepard Fairey. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster">Wikipedia</a> describes the poster as a "stylized stencil portrait".
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/">Pixelmator Pro</a> is an application for MacOS, iOS and iPadOS. These instructions apply to the MacOS version. Similar steps can be applied in other image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop specific instructions are available <a href="https://youtu.be/j2_YwylZaDE">here</a>, for example.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am working on a Processing / p5.js project to do this process in real-time from webcam input. Once that is complete, it will be available on this website and my GitHub page.
        </p>

        <h2 id="process">Process</h2>

        <h3 id="preprocess">1. Preprocess</h3>

        <p>
            Load your image, and perform any editing you want such as removing blemishes and adjusting light levels. It is a good idea, if possible, to select an image with a wide range of intensities.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="1.png" alt="Photograph of Marley Sudbury.">
            <figcaption>
                This was my starting photograph.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 id="remove-background">2. (Optional) Remove background</h3>

        <p>
            Depending on your starting image and desired results, you may need to remove the background. In my case, the background is quite messy, so I removed it.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="2.png" alt="Photograph of Marley Sudbury with background removed.">
            <figcaption>
                I removed the background using the magnetic selection tool to trace the outline.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 id="thresholding">3. Thresholding</h3>

        <p>
            This is the key to achieving this effect. A threshold is where you turn an image black and white, with each pixel's colour being determined by if it is above or below a selected threshold.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="5.png" alt="Thresholded image of Marley Sudbury.">
            <figcaption>
                My image with a threshold applied.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            First, duplicate the layer so that you have five identical layers. Then apply the threshold effect to each layer. The top layer should have the highest threshold value, and the bottom one should have the lowest. Play around with the exact threshold values for each layer, as the ideal ones will be different for each image.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="3.png" alt="Threshold effect dialogue in Pixelmator Pro.">
            <figcaption>
                Each layer should have a different threshold.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        For my image I settled on thresholds of 15%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60%. If you want to focus on details in darker sections of the image, you should have more thresholds in the lower range, and vice versa.

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="4.png" alt="Photograph of Marley Sudbury with background removed.">
            <figcaption>
                I used five different layers to match the inspiration, but you can use any number you like.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Delete black pixels</h3>

        <p>
            At the moment, if all your layers are enabled, you can only see the topmost one. To achieve the desired effect, we need to see bits of all the layers. The way we do this is by deleting all of the black pixels from each layer. To do this, select the Color Selection tool. Then press the Select Color Range... button.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="6.png" alt="Pixelmator Select Color Range... button.">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                .
            </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        In the resulting dialogue, pick the colour black. You should not need to change any of the other parameters. Then press Apply to select the black pixels and delete the selection.

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="7.png" alt="Pixelmator Select Color dialogue.">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                        .
                    </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <p>
            Repeat this for each of your layers. Your image will now be completely white, but fear not:
        </p>

        <h3>Change the colours</h3>

        <p>
            We are now going to add colour back into our image. You can pick whatever colours you like, but to reflect the inspiration I have chosen the following palette (from darkest to lightest):
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span style="color:#122F4A;background:white;">#122F4A</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:#CC322A">#CC322A</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:#78959F">#78959F</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:#F8E4AF; background:black;">#F8E4AF</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Also based on the inspiration, there will be a layer consisting on alternating stripes of the two lightest colours.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="8.png" alt="Pixelmator Select Color dialogue.">
            <figcaption>
                If the layers aren't converted into pixels, the threshold effect will still apply and they cannot be coloured.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Select all of your layers, right click and select the Convert into Pixels option. To change the colour of the layer, select the Color Adjustments tool, scroll down to the Replace Color option and select white on the left side and the replacement colour on the right hand side.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="9.png" alt="Pixelmator Select Color dialogue.">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                                .
                            </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <h3>Lines</h3>

        <p>
            Creating the line effect as we want it is surprisingly challenging in Pixelmator Pro. Create a blank layer directly above the layer that you want to be stripy. In this layer, create a white rectangle that is at least as wide as your image is tall, and vice versa. Then go into the effects tool and add the stripe generator. Select a size you want (I would recommend picking a whole number of pixels so that all the lines are the same width) and the two colours.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="11.png" alt="Pixelmator Line Generator dialogue.">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                                        .
                                    </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <p>
            The stripes in the original image are horizontal instead of vertical. To get them the right way round, right click the layer and Convert into Pixels. Then go to the arrange tool and rotate the layer 90Â°.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="12.png" alt="Pixelmator Arrange Rotate dialogue.">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                                                .
                                            </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <p>
            Now that the lines are going the right way, we need to map them onto the layer below. To do this, click the stripy layer and select Create Clipping Mask.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="13.png" alt="Pixelmator Create Clipping Mask layer option.">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                                                        .
                                                    </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <h3>Setting</h3>

        <p>
            To get the rest of the setting just right, we need the background and the frame. We will use the shape tools for each of these. Before doing this step, you should crop your image to your preferred aspect ratio and framing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The background consists of two rectangles, each half the width of the image and the full height. The colours are taken from the palette we used earlier, and are the fill of the shapes, which should have no stroke.
        </p>

        <p>
            The frame is also a rectangle, and the colour is also taken from the earlier palette, but this time it makes up the stroke of the shape, which should have no fill. Make this rectangle the size of your image, and in the stroke options set align to inside. Then adjust the size of the stroke until you are happy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Make sure that your frame goes on top of all your other layers, whilst your background rectangles should be beneath them all. The setting on its own should look something like this:
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="15.png" alt="A red rectangle and a blue rectangle. A beige border surrounds the image.">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                                                                .
                                                            </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <p>
            If all has gone well, your resulting image should be along these lines:
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="100%" src="mobama.jpg">
            <!-- <figcaption>
                                                                .
                                                            </figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <h3>(Optional) Smoothing layers</h3>

        <p>
            You may have noticed that the image as it currently stands is a lot more noisy and pixely that what we were aiming for. It is possible to get a smoother result, but it takes a bit of extra effort.
        </p>

        <p>
            I applied a uniform smoothing of 10% to each layer, but you might experience better results by smooting the less detailed layers more that the detailed layers (e.g. eyes).
        </p>

        <figure class="twofigs">

        <h2>Concluding remarks</h2>

        <p>
            I haven't included instructions here for adding text at the bottom of the image, but it is a straightforward process.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130726182913/http://ap.org/content/ap-in-the-news/2012/obama-hope-poster-artist-get-probation">The Associated Press</a>, who own the right to the photograph by Mannie Garcia that the poster was based on, Fairey was sentenced to "two years of probation and 300 hours of community service". He was also fined, and ordered to pay the AP $1,600,000. This is an example of why it is important to ensure you have the rights to download, alter and distribute any images that you edit, and to not destroy or fabricate evidence.

            I am certrainly not an expert in Pixelmator Pro, having only been using it on and off for about a year. If you think that there may be more effective or efficient ways to achieve these results, please let me know on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marleysudbury">@marleysudbury</a>.
