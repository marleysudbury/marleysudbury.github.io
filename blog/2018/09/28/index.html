			<p>Website Redesigned - 28/09/2018</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<p>My website now looks very different. I think it looks better, but I'm not renowned for my aesthetic opinions.</p>
			
			<p>For those (very few, I'm sure) who do not remember how my website looked before, here is a screenshot:</p>
			
			<img src="old.PNG" width=100%>
			
			<p>That's the Python page, because I can't be bothered to try and find the old homepage. Just imagine the above but with a different background colour and a lot more links.</p>
			<p>In case, by the time you are reading this, the website has been redesigned again, this is what it currently looks like:</p>
			
			<img src="new.PNG" width=100%>
