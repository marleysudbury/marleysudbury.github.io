		<p>Website Redesigned - 28/09/2018</p>

		<hr>

		<p>My website now looks very different. I think it looks better, but I'm not renowned for my aesthetic opinions.
		</p>

		<!-- <p>For those (very few, I'm sure) who do not remember how my website looked before, here is a screenshot:</p> -->

		<p>Here's how my site looked before:</p>

		<img src="old.PNG" width=100%>

		<p>(That's the Python page, because I can't be bothered to try and find the old homepage. Just imagine the above
			but with a different background colour and a lot more links.)</p>

		<!-- <p>In case, by the time you are reading this, the website has been redesigned again, this is what it currently looks like:</p> -->

		<p>Here's how my site looks at the time of writing:</p>

		<img src="new.PNG" width=100%>

		<!-- <p>My previous website (Arinazil) was also very different. You can read about that in <a href="../../../2016/06/04/">this old blog post</a>.</p> -->

		<p>With this redesign I'm aiming to make my website look vaguely modern, and not like a historical artifact.</p>
