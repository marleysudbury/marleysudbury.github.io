			<p>My First Flask Site - 26/03/2019</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<p>I recently undertook a project to build an e-commerce website using Python, Flask, SQL and a bunch of other things, most of which were completely new to me. Here's how that went.</p>
			
			<p>So, first of all you need to have the vision. My vision was for a camera store modelled stylistically somewhat on Amazon (if it ain't broke don't fix it), which I creatively named 'Marley's Camera Shop'. It is perhaps worth noting at this point that the aim of this was not to actually sell cameras, but to learn the gist of Flask.</p>
			
			<p>The following is a partial check-list of what was required:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Users can register and login</li>
				<li>Users can add items to their basket</li>
				<li>Users can checkout items</li>
				<li>Users can add items to their wishlist</li>
				<li>Products are stored in MySQL database</li>
				<li>Lists generated are sortable and generated programmatically</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This is part of the file routes.py. It is the code that is run when a user attempts to access the home page of the website. It checks if the user has a cart or wishlist in their session (cookies), and if they don't then it creates one that's empty.</p>
