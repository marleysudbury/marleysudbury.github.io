			<h1>Marley Sudbury</h1>
			Some highlights from my journal.
		</div>

		<p>
			I've been keeping a (mostly) regular journal now for more than half a year. Doing some re-reading, I realised there are a few interesting 'jems'. Please enjoy!
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				"Feeling melancholy in spite of everything, but thus is life in the modern age of technology."
				<ul>
					<li>
						One of many early passages in which I find things to blame for my mental state other than myself.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I'm just not equipped to help her feel better. Also, I'm not man enough to break it off, so I'll push things too far, which will probably fuck her up even more, and drive me mad with guilt… Gosh, I really need a more positive outlook on life!"
				<ul>
					<li>
						Here, I start to have some self awareness.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I was ready to have a big and important conversation with ***** on Friday, but I guess now I'll never get around to it."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Disgusting lack of communication skills.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I wonder how I'll feel about this document in a few years. I suppose it'll be cringey."
				<ul>
					<li>
						You don't know the half of it.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Next Thursday (the 14th) is looking to be pretty hectic: in the morning, I'm missing school to go and sing at old people with Max, Alex and Sam. Then Sam, Max and I have the awards ceremony, and we want to do a wine thing after. Goodness me. I'm looking forward to it, obviously!"
				<ul>
					<li>
						2017 Marley was flustered by the thought of having to do more than two things in one day.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I haven't bought any Christmas presents yet, typical white male trash that I am. Hopefully I will rectify this on Saturday."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Sincerely doubt I'll ever be good at crimbo shopping.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"***** got super triggered when I mentioned weed, now we both hate ourselves. She can't even say sorry without making everything about her. Then she asks if I'm alright, and when I say no she doesn't respond. I'm not exactly any better."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Brilliant example of how to not avoid red flags in a relationship. A skill I have mastered.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"***** held my hand the whole way home, which made us both feel better. I nearly got her to mine, but her mum found us first."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Brief glimpse into the positive side of that relationship. Holding hands also gave me a boner, btw.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Mr. ****** has given Will, George and I 'Intervention' after Christmas. What a load of bullshit. He also said my independent learning 'requires improvement'. Wanker!
				<ul>
					<li>
						A rare occasion where my love for authority fails, and I pour vitriolic hatred for one of the dopiest teachers I've ever met.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"She showed me her diary and it had a heart next to my name."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ways in which my journal is the worst, number 1.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Although I still have no idea how to make-out properly, turns out kissing is a piece of piss. I'm not too sure who initiated the first one, which makes me fairly certain it wasn't me. Honestly this all so good!"
				<ul>
					<li>
						Still a cute memory, somehow.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"It's Christmas day! Woo-hoo! I must confess to having failed to document a particularly juicy few days."
				<ul>
					<li>
						As I say, mostly regular.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"***** invited me round for dinner, but I refused because I'm an awkward cunt. I feel really bad about it, but apparently we're seeing each other tomorrow. I'd like that, but I don't want to go to hers (no privacy or physical intimacy, 'I wouldn't let you near me') and if it's at mine she might just cancel."
				<ul>
					<li>
						"Awkward cunt", says it all really.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Officially 2018—crazy. This year, if all goes to plan, I should turn 18, finish my A-levels and go off to university. Short-term, however, I have to memorise loads of facts for politics test tomorrow."
				<ul>
					<li>
						All going according to plan so far.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Alex said that he thinks me and ***** are like him and Phoebe. Whilst I understand his point that I don't seem very happy about the relationship at the moment, I refute his observation that there's 'many fish in the sea', as I believe the things worrying me would occur with any girl, even ones that aren't 'crazy'."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Top-notch red flag aversion, as always.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I'm trying my best to do politics homework, but it's boring me out of my tiny little mind. Max is the first person I've spoken to who has reacted negatively to me doing dry January, he reckons I won't make it."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Well I did do it, so fuck you Max.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I haven't made these resolutions easy on myself, there's beer and cider in the fridge, as well as a cigarette both literally and figuratively over my head right now."
				<ul>
					<li>
						I used to keep tobacco on the shelf above my desk. So creative with these techniques.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"If ***** and Jess swapped places in this drama, I would probably kill Alex. Actually I probably would have killed both of them. Guess that shows Sam really is better than me after all. Missing Christmas already, especially the snow which was beautiful."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Mental instability disguised as a compliment.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Although I like Alex and Jess, I do feel like they need a dose of empathy. I don't want to go down with their sinking ship."
				<ul>
					<li>
						LMFAO.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"This really stressed me out, and I thought we were going to break up. However, she came back to mine after school, and after sufficient snogging + boob sucking, I'm pretty sure that's not what she wants."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Nah bro, she clearly wants the D.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				NSFW: "She took off her bra to sleep, and let me play with her boobs. In the morning (stopped trying to sleep about 6.30 AM) I did so again, and this time sucked on them, as in proper on the nipple. She seemed to like that and started rubbing my dick through my jeans. I tried to return the favour through her (moist) leggings, but she didn't seem so keen on the idea."
				<ul>
					<li>
						This is all disgusting, but particularly the word "moist".
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				NSFW: "I then noticed how wet and sticky her boob was. This amused me greatly."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Yep.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Think I might buy a pipe when I can smoke again. I feel it would be fun."
				<ul>
					<li>
						I did buy a pipe, and I can confirm that it is fun.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I refused though, and made Matt and Tom do it. Another thing on the list of things to taunt Marley about, along with being a pussy and a cuck."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Edgy self-deprecation. What a dingus.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"Didn't think much of it at first, but I'm growing to enjoy the old cunning linguistics."
				<ul>
					<li>
						I am a literal child by the way.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"She wanted to do something on Saturday, but I said if she's going out with her friends then I should go out with mine. She said they're her friends too, I'm not sure why."
				<ul>
					<li>
						The pathetic mind-games of a 17 year old.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I really want to go on a romantic summer getaway with ***. She said she'd like too if she's allowed. I will not be impressed if her parents still control her life when she's 18. Might as well be going out with an Egg-Sandwich."
				<ul>
					<li>
						In which Marley throws some serious shade at the Sandwiches.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I was ok with the hickey and the scratching, but had to draw the line when she squeezed my balls too hard."
				<ul>
					<li>
						The worst physical pain I've ever endured.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				"I got another massive box of Ferrero Rocher, which I'll give to *** to make her fat."
				<ul>
					<li>
						Exploit any weakness. I mean, don't. Plan worked, though.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
