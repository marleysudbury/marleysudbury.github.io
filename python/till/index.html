		<p>
			What is a till system? Well, in short I will be designing here, for you, a piece of Python code that would not look out of place at a supermarket checkout (apart from the fact it's in Python, lol).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The first step, as always when designing a piece of software, is to set out our requirements:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Should have two modes (regular and admin).</li>
			<li>Should be able to create, view and delete items in the admin mode.</li>
			<li>Items should be stored in a .txt file.</li>
			<li>Items can be 'scanned' (in this case, manually entering a code).</li>
			<li>Items should have three parts (code, name and price).</li>
			<li>All parts of the program should be accessible without having to restart it.</li>
			<li>Items can be added to the basket.</li>
			<li>Can calculate change to be given.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Now, when actually implementing this, we have to consider the programming side of things. This program will use lots of functions, such as:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>A function for regular use.</li>
			<li>A function for admin use.</li>
			<li>A function for scanning / returning item data.</li>
			<li>A function for adding to the basket.</li>
			<li>A function for calculating change.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Let's write the bare-bones of this program, so we can figure out where everything should go.
		</p>
<pre>
rPassword = "Jolly"
aPassword = "Jelly"
def wrong():
	print("WRONG!")
	startup()
def regOp():
	pssw = input("Password: ")
	if (pssw != rPassword):
		wrong()
def admOp():
	pssw = input("Admin Password: ")
	if (pssw != aPassword):
		wrong()
def startup():
	# Welcome message
	mode = input("0 (Regular) | 1 (Admin): ")
	if (mode == 0):
		regOp()
	else:
		admOp()

startup()
</pre>
