			I'll assume that you are reading this after reading <a href="../sorting"><em>Sorting Algorithms in Python</em></a>, as this will require that knowledge later on.
		</p>

		<h3>Linear Search</h3>

		<p>
			Our first searching algorthm is called the linear searching algorithm. This, as the name would suggest, searches through a data set one at a time from the first to the last, until the correct is found, or the end is reached. The data does not need to be sorted for a linear search.
		</p>

		<p>
			The pseudo code for a linear search function would be like so:
		</p>
<pre>
function linSearch(alist, find):
	found = false;
	index = 0;
	while (!found AND index < len(alist)):
		if (alist[index] == find):
			found = true;
		else:
			index++;
	if (!found):
		return -1;
	else:
		return index;
</pre>
		<p>
			This can be translated into the following Python code:
		</p>
<pre>
def linSearch(alist, find):
	found = False
	index = 0
	while (found == False & index < len(alist)):
		if (alist[index] == find):
			found = True
		else:
			index += 1
	if (found == False):
		return -1
	else:
		return index
</pre>
		<p>
			If called as "print(linSearch([1,2,3],2)", it would print "1".
		</p>

		<h3>Binary Search</h3>

		<p>
			This algorithm is usually, although not always, more efficient than a linear search, but it should be considered that it requires the data to be sorted. For this reason, you may want to use one of the previously mentioned sorting algorithms in conjunction, if you want to search unsorted data this way.
		</p>

		<p>
			The pseudocode for a binary search would be:
		</p>
<pre>
function binSearch(alist, find):
	lbound = 0;
	ubound = len(alist);
	found = false;
	while (found == false AND lbound < ubound):
		midpoint = round((ubound + lbound) / 2);
		if (alist[midpoint] == find):
			found = true;
		else:
			if (alist[midpoint] > find):
				ubound = midpoint - 1;
			else:
				lbound = midpoint + 1;
</pre>
