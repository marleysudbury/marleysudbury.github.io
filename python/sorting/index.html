		</div>

		<p>
			Important things to explain: Python is an interpretive
			programming language, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm
			which sorts elements in a list or array. I'm using Python
			because it is a pretty good language for these sorts of
			things, in my opinion. I'm sure that you'll be able to
			implement these and other sorting algorithms in whatever
			language you want, so go do that.
		</p>

		<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>

		<p>
			One of the least efficient sorting algorithms, but a good
			place for begginers, the bubble sort is a sorting algorithm
			which I believe every good programmer should have memorised.
			It works by going through the list and comparing each pair,
			swapping if the one on the left is larger than the one on
			the right, until there are no more swaps to make.
		</p>

		<p>
			The pseudo code for a bubble sort function would be like so:
		</p>
<pre>
function bubSort(alist):
	swapped = true;
	while (swapped):
		swapped = false;
		for (i = 0 to len(alist) - 1):
			if (alist[i] > alist[i+1]):
				temp = alist[i];
				alist[i] = alist[i+1];
				alist[i+1] = temp;
				swapped = true;
	return alist;
</pre>
		<p>
			This can be translated into the following Python code:
		</p>
<pre>
def bubSort(alist):
	swapped = True
	while (swapped):
		swapped = False
		for i in range(0, len(alist) - 1):
			if (alist[i] > alist[i+1]):
				temp = alist[i]
				alist[i] = alist[i+1]
				alist[i+1] = temp
				swapped = True
	return alist
</pre>
		<p>
			Which really isn't that different to the pseudocode, hmm.
			When this function is given an unordered list, it orders
			them, just like you would expect, but it isn't very pretty,
			and it can be difficult to see how it works. Solution?:
		</p>
<pre>
def bubSort(alist):
	print(alist)
	swapped = True
	while (swapped):
		swapped = False
		for i in range(0, len(alist) - 1):
			if (alist[i] > alist[i+1]):
				temp = alist[i]
				alist[i] = alist[i+1]
				alist[i+1] = temp
				swapped = True
				print(alist)
	return alist
</pre>
		<p>
			Yes, there are only two more lines. Example output:
		</p>
<pre>
[5, 3, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
[3, 4, 2, 5, 1]
[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</pre>
		<p>
			Much prettier in my opinion, although this is perhaps now
			more suited to a procedure than a function. Due
			to the fact that it retains the return instruction, it is
			still a function.
		</p>

		<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>

		<p>
			As mentioned, the bubble sort is a fairly inefficient
			sorting algorithm. A slightly better one is the insertion
			sort, which works by comparing the next number in the
			unsorted list to each one in the sorted list until you find
			the right location for it. It is a bit like an inside out
			bubble sort.
		</p>

		<p>
			The pseudocode for an insertion sort function would be thus:
		</p>
<pre>
function insSort(alist):
	for (i = 1 to len(alist)):
		cnt = i;
		while (alist[cnt] &lt; alist[cnt - 1]):
			temp = alist[cnt];
			alist[cnt] = alist[cnt - 1];
			alist[cnt - 1] = temp;
			cnt--;
	return alist;
</pre>
		<p>
			Already two lines shorter than the bubble sort! Actual
			Python script:
		</p>
<pre>
def insSort(alist):
	for i in range(1, len(alist)):
		cnt = i
		while (alist[cnt] &lt; alist[cnt - 1] and cnt > 0):
			temp = alist[cnt]
			alist[cnt] = alist[cnt - 1]
			alist[cnt - 1] = temp
			cnt -= 1
	return alist
</pre>
		<p>
			Again, remarkably similar to the pseudocode. Similar to
			last time, it is quite difficult to visualise the
			sorting process which is actually going on here, but:
		</p>
<pre>
def insSort(alist):
	print(alist)
	for i in range(1, len(alist)):
		cnt = i
		while (alist[cnt] &lt; alist[cnt - 1] and cnt > 0):
			temp = alist[cnt]
			alist[cnt] = alist[cnt - 1]
			alist[cnt - 1] = temp
			cnt -= 1
		print(alist)
	return alist
</pre>
		<p>
			Two more lines is enough to give us a nice idea of what
			is happening. Example output:
		</p>
<pre>
[5, 3, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]
[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</pre>
		<p>
			BTW, that is half as many steps as the bubble sort, for
			the same data set. There are many other sorting
			algorithms, but I don't know how to implement them off
			the top of my head. (&lt;-- A stack(LIFO) reference)
		</p>

		<p>
			P.S. I made a codepen for this. Yes, I know that codepen
			is for front-end web development, but I don't think
			there are any rules against this sort of thing. Anyway:
			<a href =
			"https://codepen.io/marleysudbury/pen/OgVyyO">
			link</a>. Also, if you want the programs in Python, but
			can't be bothered to copy and paste it download these:
			<a href = "bubSort.py">bubSort.py</a> &amp; <a href
			= "insSort.py">insSort.py</a>. As I mentioned, if
			you are programming-savvy, as I suspect you are if you
			are still reading, have a go at implementing some other
			sorting algorithms. Check <a href =
			"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Popular
			_sorting_algorithms">here</a> if you need some
			inspiration.
