			What is cuneiform? Cuneiform is a writing system which emerged in the late fourth millennium B.C. It literally means "wedge-shaped", which makes sense as it consists of wedge-shaped marks made in clay.

			What does the cuneiform at the top of the page mean? Can you really not work that one out? It is "Marley Sudbury" spelled out phonetically in cuneiform. I think, but what do I know? I'm fairly certain that this isn't how names actually worked in cuneiform, but who cares, right? It might also just appear as some boxes, in which case, click <a href="header.PNG">here</a> to see what I'm on about.
