            <h2>Photography</h2>
            
            <p>I did a GCSE in Photography, and it was surprisingly one of the most stressful qualifications I've done. In any case, it is now a hobby that I enjoy very much, at least when I have the time to do it.</p>

            <p>Above is a little gallery of images I shot with my Olympus OM-10, I believe on Fujifilm's Fujicolour C200, but it was a while ago and my memory's a little fuzzy. I think that shooting film is better&hellip;er, easier, as it naturally looks good without the need for editing that comes with digital photos.</p>

            <p>Above are some of the digital photographs I've taken over the years (all, I believe, with my trusty Nikon D5300). The dates provided are when they were taken, though for many of them they were edited at a later date.</p>

            <p>I have recently become quite interested in journalism, and maybe I'll put a little bit of my own on here. If I have enough spare time, that is.</p>-->
