		<h1>Quotes of Significance</h1>
		<h2>A list by M.S.R. Sudbury</h2>
		<p>
			“¡No pasaran!”—<em>They shall not pass!</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			This quote is used to express opposition to and defiance against an enemy. Most famously during the Battle of Verdun (The French being “Ils ne passeront pas!”), later used in the Battle of Madrid, by the Communists, against the nationalist/facist forces. Generalisimo Franco famously responded, after the capture of Madrid, “Hemos passado.”—<em>We have passed</em>.

			“At eleven o’clock this morning came to an end the cruellest and most terrible War that has ever scourged mankind. I hope we may say that thus, this fateful morning, came to an end all wars.”
		</p>

			David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor—11th of November 1918
		</p>
		<p>
			This quote is really quite important to me, firstly as I feel it highlights many key aspects of humanity which thoroughly deserve highlighting. We don't learn from our mistakes. We did the worst thing ever, and instead of never doing it again, we one-upped ourselves less than three decades later. Also, I am a liberal, and Lloyd George was the last liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and I think this shows the ideological shift in the UK, that is to say: the decay of consensus politics, as well as the emergence of more devisicive political outlooks.

			“All evil results from the non-adaptation of constitution to conditions. This is true of everything that lives.”
		</p>

			Herbert Spencer—‘The Evanescence of Evil’
		</p>
		<p>
			As previously mentioned, I am a liberal. Therefore, I am fascinated by the people who shaped this ideology, a.k.a. classical liberal thinkers. Of theses, I can think of none so fine as Herbert Spencer. However, Mr. Spencer's brilliance far exceeds the political, as he advances into science, poetry, sociology and many other areas. This quote is important to consider, as it can be applied to modern life, too. We cannot hope to be good if we cannot change. Many people need reminding of this.

			“This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be! It's expired and gone to meet its maker! This is a late parrot! It's a stiff Bereft of life, it rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies! Its metabolic processes are now history! He's off the twig! He's kicked the bucket, he's shuffled off the mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible! This is an ex-parrot!”

			“Well, I'd better replace it then.”

			‘Monty Python's Flying Circus’—Series 1 Episode 8 (‘Full Frontal Nudity’)
		</p>
		<p>
			To be honest, I don't have much respect for people who quote <em>Python</em> verbatim, it seems rather not-in-the-spirit, although I equally believe that nobody of good character can live their life without having such knowledge, just in case it comes in handy. But remember, always be python-esque, not just python-ese.
