Are you still there?
          C     F
With your green eyes
         G     Am
And your white lies
         C    F
And your pale lips
      C   F
Which tasted
Am G
So sweet
   Am
So sweet

                                   E
I'm scared to know where you go at night
       Am                                  E
But it ain't for me to say what's wrong or right
        G                                      Am
But you know that and you wouldn't let me if I tried

Blonde hair
       C    F
I know just where
          C    F
With your thin disguise
         G    Am
And your weak alibis
   C      F
No one believes it
    C           F
And that's what makes it
Am G
So sad
   Am
So sad

                                   E
I'm scared to know where you go at night
       Am                                  E
But it ain't for me to say what's wrong or right
        G                                      Am
But you know that and you wouldn't let me if I tried

Blonde hair
     C     F
Feel my despair
   C          F
As springtime dies
   G      Am
So end my highs
     C           F
I've packed your things
    C       F
Now time to say
Am G
So long
   Am   E   Am
So long
