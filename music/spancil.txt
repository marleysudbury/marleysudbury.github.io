     Am             G                               Am
Last night as I lay dreaming, of pleasant days gone by,
                                   C             G
Me mind being bent on rambling, to Ireland I did fly,
  Am                             C               G
I stepped on board a vision, and followed with a will,
         Am                    G                       Am
'Til the next I came to anchor at the cross at Spancil Hill.

                        G                        Am              
It being on the 23rd of June, the day before the fair 
                            C                           G
When Ireland's sons and daughters and friends assembled there
      Am                              C                       G
The young, the old, the brave and the bold came their duty to fulfil
       Am                 G                            Am
At the parish church near Clooney, a mile from Spancil Hill

                 G                                 Am
I went to see me neighbours to see what they might say
                                          C                  G
The old ones were all dead and gone, they young ones turning grey
  Am                      C                    G
I met the tailor Quigley, he's as bald as ever still
        Am              G                                Am
Sure he used to make me britches when I lived in Spancil Hill

                G                          Am
I paid a flying visit to my first and only love
                          C                  G
She's as fair as any lily and as gentle as a dove
    Am                               C                G
She threw her arms around me, saying Johnny I love ye still
        Am               G                                 Am
She was Nell the farmers daughter and the pride of Spancil Hill

                     G                            Am
I dreamed I held and kissed her as in the days of yore
                                  C               G
Ah Johnny, you're only joking, as many's the time before
         Am                               C                  G
Then the cock, he crew in the morning, he crew both loud and shrill
  Am              G                            Am
I awoke in California, many miles from Spancil Hill
