For nearly sixty years, I've been a cocky
   G                                                 D7        
Of droughts and fires and floods, I've lived through plenty
          G                  G7       C                 G
Yes, this country's dust and mud, has seen my tears and blood
                     D7               C    G
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy


  G              G7              C        
I married a fine girl when I was twenty
        G                                 D7        
But she died in giving birth when she was thirty
   G             G7           C                G
No Flying Doctor then, just a gentle old black gin
                     D7               C    G
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

    G                G7         C          
She left me with two sons and a daughter
      G                                      D7       
And a bone-dry farm whose soil cried out for water
      G                  G7              C                G
So my care was rough and ready, but they grew up fine and steady
                     D7               C    G
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

   G                G7                  C          
My daughter married young, and went her own way
   G                            D7        
My sons lie buried by the Burma Railway
           G                 G7        C            G
So on this land I've made my own, I've carried on a-lone
                     D7               C    G
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

     G            G7                C
City folks, these days, despise the cocky
         G                                D7
Say with subsidies and dole, we've had it easy
               G                   G7             C                G
But there's no drought or starving stock, on your sewered suburban block
                     D7               C    G
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

    G            G7                 C       
For nearly sixty years, I've been a cocky

Of droughts and fires and floods, I've lived through plenty

But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
