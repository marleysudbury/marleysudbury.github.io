    Am
The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn
F          C            G           Am
now is the time,  for a child to be born
      Am                                Em
he'll laugh at the moon and cry for the sun
    F         C           G       Am
and if it's a boy,  he'll carry a gun
         Dm           Am
sang the crow, on the cradle

    Am
and if it should be that this baby's a girl
F         C           G            Am
never you mind if her hair doesn't curl
     Am                                    Em
with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
      F       C            G        Am
and a bomber above her wherever she goes
         Dm           Am
sang the crow, on the cradle

    Am
the crow on the cradle, the black and the white
F          C          G          Am
somebody's baby,   is born for a fight
    Am                                    Em
the crow on the cradle, the white and the black
F          C         G          Am
somebody's baby,  is not coming back
         Dm          Am
sang the crow, on the cradle

     Am
your mother and father will sweat and they'll slave
   F           C          G         Am
to build you a coffin and dig you a grave
Am                               Em
hush-a-bye little one, never you weep
    F           C            G          Am
for we've got a toy that can put you to sleep
         Dm            Am
sang the crow   on the cradle

Am
bring me my gun, and I'll shoot that bird dead
F                C          G           Am
that's what your mother and father once said
    Am                               Em
the crow on the cradle, what can we do
    F         C               G           Am
Ah, this is a thing that I'll leave up to you
         Dm            Am       Em
sang the crow   on the cradle
F         C                 G           Am
this is a thing,  that I'll leave up to you
         Dm           Am
sang the crow  on the cradle
