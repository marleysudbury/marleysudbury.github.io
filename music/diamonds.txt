     Em
Well I'll be damned
                C
Here comes your ghost again
                 G
But that's not unusual
                   D
It's just that the moon is full
                    Em   Em/Gb   Em
And you happened to call


And here I sit
            C
Hand on the telephone
          G
Hearing a voice I'd known
            D
A couple of light years ago
                       Em   Em/Gb   Em
Heading straight for a fall


As I remember your eyes
                C
Were bluer than robin's eggs
              G
My poetry was lousy you said
              D
Where are you calling from?
               Em   Em/Gb   Em
A booth in the Midwest


Ten years ago
                  C
I bought you some cufflinks
               G
You brought me something
                  D
We both know what memories can bring
                        Em   Em/Gb   Em
They bring diamonds and rust

 
Well you burst on the scene
          C
Already a legend
                G
The unwashed phenomenon
             D        
The original vagabond
                    Em   Em/Gb   Em
You strayed into my arms


And there you stayed
            C
Temporarily lost at sea
                G
The Madonna was yours for free
                    D            
Yes the girl on the half-shell
               Em   Em/Gb   Em
Would keep you unharmed

    Bm
Now I see you standing

With brown leaves falling around
                 Am
And snow in your hair
    Bm
Now you're smiling out the window

Of that crummy hotel
                Am
Over Washington Square
    C
Our breath comes out white clouds
                         G
Mingles and hangs in the air
         Fmaj7
Speaking strictly for me
                                 G    B7
We both could have died then and there

    Em
Now you're telling me
              C
You're not nostalgic
                     G
Then give me another word for it
               D
You who are so good with words
                      Em   Em/Gb   Em  
And at keeping things vague


Because I need some of that vagueness now
                       C
It's all come back too clearly
                G
Yes I loved you dearly
                          D
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
             Em   Em/Gb   Em
I've already paid
