   C         G             Am          F
In Mullingar Town with the sun shining down
       C               G              C         G
At the fleadhs and the feis’s and the fairs
       C            G              Am            F
At the weddings and wakes, and the sports by the lakes
         C              G           C
I played tunes ‘til the dawn of the day
           Am                           E
And by the auld Dublin Bridge, I played reels and slip jigs
      G             D             G
As me fingers, they danced up and down
       C            G        Am          F
Now, I long for the day when again I can play
        C               G         C
The old squeezebox from Mullingar Town

I remember the day when I earned my first pay
I went off to the second hand shop
I paid ten shillings down, and each week half a crown
‘til I paid for me little squeexzebox
And I practiced each day ‘til I learned how to play
‘til me fingers could dance up and down
In my little bedroom, I learned my first tune
On me squeezebox in Mullingar Town

Each year on the day, I went off to play
With the feis at the grand County Hall
And feeling right proud, with a mighty fine crowd
Of three hundred and fifty in all
Step dancers, galore, who could burn up the floor
Fine musicians made beautiful sounds
But they all came to see young Ritchie Tommy and me
On me squeezebox in Mullingar Town

        D            A           Bm           G
Now, me suit is well-pressed and I’ll be well-dressed
        A                     D         A
For I’m going back home there again
         D            A               Bm        G
And I’ll catch a fast plane, take the Mullingar train
      D           A          D
For I miss all my family and friends
     Bm                      F#
Now, I bet all the boys have children and wives
           A              E         A
Sure, it’s near time that I settled down
     D               A     Bm         G
And, I’ll be back to stay, forever to play
       D               A         D
