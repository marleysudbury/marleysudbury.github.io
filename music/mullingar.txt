   C         G             Am          F
In Mullingar Town with the sun shining down
       C               G              C         G
At the fleadhs and the feis’s and the fairs
       C            G              Am            F
At the weddings and wakes, and the sports by the lakes
         C              G           C
I played tunes ‘til the dawn of the day
           Am                           E
And by the auld Dublin Bridge, I played reels and slip jigs
      G             D             G
As me fingers, they danced up and down
       C            G        Am          F
Now, I long for the day when again I can play
        C                G         C
The old squeezebox round Mullingar Town

  C            G          Am              F
I remember the day when I earned my first pay
       C          G           C         G
I went off to the second hand shop
       C             G              Am          F
I paid ten shillings down, and each week half a crown
       C           G             C
‘til I paid for me little squeezebox
      Am                        E
And I practiced each day ‘til I learned how to play
        G             D            G
‘til me fingers could dance up and down
      C         G       Am               F
In my little bedroom, I learned my first tune
      C             G         C
On me squeezebox in Mullingar Town

     C           G      A           F
Each year on the day, I went off to play
         C           G            C         G
With the feis at the grand County Hall
    C             G             Am          F
And feeling right proud, with a mighty fine crowd
   C                 G        C
Of three hundred and fifty in all
     Am                         E
Step dancers, galore, who could burn up the floor
     G              D         G
Fine musicians made beautiful sounds
         C           G         Am                F
But they all came to see young Ritchie Tommy and me
      C             G         C

        D            A           Bm           G
Now, me suit is well-pressed and I’ll be well-dressed
        A                     D         A
For I’m going back home there again
         D            A               Bm        G
And I’ll catch a fast plane, take the Mullingar train
      D           A          D
For I miss all my family and friends
     Bm                      F#
Now, I bet all the boys have children and wives
           A              E         A
Sure, it’s near time that I settled down
     D               A     Bm         G
And, I’ll be back to stay, forever to play
       D               A         D

I’ll be back home to stay, forever to play
