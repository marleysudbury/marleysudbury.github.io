                This text-based RPG was developed by a team of fellow
                students, and myself. There is a bit of documentation on the
                Github wiki, so give it a whirl.
            </p>

                I specifically did the evidence system, the combat system and a
                few bits of bug fixing. Our game won the votes of fellow
                students (I think due to the engaging story), and as a result of
                this I was given the <em>SQL Pocket Guide</em>.
