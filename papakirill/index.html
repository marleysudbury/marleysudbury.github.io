        <p>
            This text-based RPG was developed by a team of students. There is a
            bit of documentation on the GitHub wiki, so give it a whirl.

            I specifically worked on the evidence system, the combat/dancing
            system and a few bits of bug fixing. In a poll of fellow students,
            our game won the most votes (I think due to the engaging story),
            and we were given academic books. I got the <em>SQL Pocket
            Guide</em>.
