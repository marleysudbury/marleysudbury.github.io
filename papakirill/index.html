        <p>
            This text-based RPG was developed by a team of students. There is a bit of documentation on the
            Github wiki, so give it a whirl.

            I specifically worked on the evidence system, the combat/dancing system and a
            few bits of bug fixing. In a poll of fellow students, our game won the most votes (I think due to the
            engaging story), and as a result I won a copy of the <em>SQL Pocket Guide</em>.
