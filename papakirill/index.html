            He opened his umbrella and checked the address. He didnâ€™t recognise
            his surroundings, but the number propped on the grey wall in front
            of him confirmed that this is where his uncle stays. Quite a bit
            had changed since he was a toddler&hellip;

            I worked on this text-based RPG with a team of six other students
            in my first year at university.
            It is written in Python, and as well as an in-game tutorial there
            is documentation of some features and controls on <a href=
            "https://github.com/marleysudbury/PapaKirill/wiki">GitHub Wiki</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My specific contributions were on the <a href=
            "https://github.com/marleysudbury/PapaKirill/issues/17">evidence
            system</a>, the <a href=
            "https://github.com/marleysudbury/PapaKirill/issues/24"
            >combat/dancing system</a> and a few bits of bug fixing. I also
            wrote the Wiki pages.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the students in the class got together to play each other's
            games in the computer lab, and to vote for their favourite. Against
            some stiff competition, <em>Papa Kirill's Pizzeria</em> won! As a
            prize we were given some books. I got a copy of the <a href=
        "https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781449397586/"
            ><em>O'Reilly SQL Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition</em></a>.
