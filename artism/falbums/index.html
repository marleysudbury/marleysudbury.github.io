			Fake album covers

		<p>
			For many people, the art of the album cover is nigh as important as the art of music itself. When looking through my old photographs, I often see some which I feel would be right at home in my iTunes library, and here are a few that I have thrown together in Photoshop. The main purpose of this exercise is to gain a stronger appreciation of framing and arrangement, which I usually only consider before taking the shot.

				<td><img src="twin_blades.jpg" width=200px></td>
				<td>Not really sure what sort of songs would be on here, but I like the idea of some sort of <em>Arctic Monkeys</em>-esque stuff. Not much cropped out of this image, as it was already a close-up of an electric hand-fan.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">The Cornwall Collection</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="sounds_of_Cornwall.jpg" width=200px></td>
				<td>In case you're wondering, no this is not literally an album of sea-noise. Just folk music and shanties from the Cornwall area (don't actually know if such things exist). Original image was a lot larger, large amount of cliff cropped out.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">Back in Summer</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="back_in_summer.jpg" width=200px></td>
				<td>I'm not as big a fan of summer as some people, but it was irresistible to fuse Cheltenham scenery with a <em>Beach Boys</em> vibe.</td>
