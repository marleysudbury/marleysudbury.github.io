			<h1>Marley Sudbury</h1>
			Fake album covers
		</div>
		
		<!--<p>
			For many people, the art of the album cover is nigh as important as the art of music itself. When looking through my old photographs, I often see some which I feel would be right at home in my iTunes library, and here are a few that I have thrown together in Photoshop. The main purpose of this exercise is to gain a stronger appreciation of framing and arrangement, which I usually only consider before taking the shot.
		</p>-->
		
		<p>
			These albums are not real. Yet :P. All images and photographs made by me; edited in Photoshop.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Twin Blades</h2>
			
		<a href="twin_blades.jpg"><img src="twin_blades.jpg" width=400px></a>
				
		<!--<td>Not really sure what sort of songs would be on here, but I like the idea of some sort of <em>Arctic Monkeys</em>-esque stuff. Not much cropped out of this image, as it was already a close-up of an electric hand-fan.</td>-->
				
		<p>
			New, alternative, and rocky. Reminiscent of early <em>Arctic Monkeys</em>. A vivid portal into another persons life.
		</p>

		<h2>The Cornwall Collection</h2>

		<a href="sounds_of_Cornwall.jpg"><img src="sounds_of_Cornwall.jpg" width=400px></a>
				
		<!--<td>In case you're wondering, no this is not literally an album of sea-noise. Just folk music and shanties from the Cornwall area (don't actually know if such things exist). Original image was a lot larger, large amount of cliff cropped out.</td>-->
				
		<p>
			A collection of stirring shanties and folk ballads from the county of Cornwall. Part of a series.
		</p>

		<h2>Back in Summer</h2>
		
		<a href="back_in_summer.jpg"><img src="back_in_summer.jpg" width=400px></a>
				
		<!--<td>I'm not as big a fan of summer as some people, but it was irresistible to fuse Cheltenham scenery with a <em>Beach Boys</em> vibe.</td>-->
				
		<p>
			Beach Boys, but without the beach (and just the one boy!). A warm reminisce.
		</p>

		<h2>Who the Fuck (Am I)?</h2>
		
		<a href="who_the_fuck.jpg"><img src="who_the_fuck.jpg" width=400px></a>
				
		<p>
			The eyes are the windows to the soul. What the fuck's going on in there? A very serious exploration of emotion.
		</p>

		<h2>Gone</h2>
		
		<a href="gone.jpg"><img src="gone.jpg" width=400px></a>
				
		<p>
			Wacky take on heart break. A journey to the tortured heart of an old(?) man, shown through the lens of youth.
		</p>
		
		<h2>No Idea</h2>
		
		<a href="no_idea.jpg"><img src="no_idea.jpg" width=400px></a>
				
		<p>
			Short album exploring the gaining and losing of faith, as well as musical taste. Very experimental.
