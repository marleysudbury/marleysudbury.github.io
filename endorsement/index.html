        <h2>Feedback from supervisor</h2>

        <p>
            As part of my industrial placement, my university asked my workplace supervisor to provide feedback about
            me. Here are some of the things that were written:
        </p>

        <p>
            "Marley is doing exceptionally well, demonstrating he is a capable and knowledgeable individual. He is
            willing to take on more complex jobs and has no trouble at all performing even the most difficult tasks our
            customers can throw at him. He works very well independently and has adapted exteremely well to challenges
            around working from home due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Marley's attention to detail is fantastic, surpassing that of some permenant staff in the team. I am
            particularly impressed with his record keeping. One of the most important aspects of the job is great
            communication within the team and he always does this to a high standard. His updates to IT incidents and
            service requests are thorough and he follows all instructions given very carefully, asking appropriate
            questions when necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Marley is an asset to the team! He has been so helpful and he fits in so well with the rest of the team!"
        </p>

        <h2>Teacher tribute</h2>

        <p>
            After I finished my A levels and went to univeristy, my sixth form got in touch to let me know I was the
            2018 recipient of their Graduate Award for Computer Science. This was partly for my Minesweeper project,
            which <a href="../minesweeper/">you can read about here</a>. The following teacher tribute was included with
            the award:
        </p>

        <p>
            "Mr Hunt told me at the end of year 12 Marley would get an A. He knew right from the start of the course
            that he was an uncut diamond. I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said I'd agreed with him. The Marley I
            knew was quiet and reserved, not a "shiner". Did he hand his work in? No. Did it matter? No! Organisation
            was not really Marley's strong point - he was far too busy navigating the tricky path of teenage love, and
            we all enjoyed the journey too. Women are not an algorithm Marley, don't attempt to apply your computational
            thinking skills there!
        </p>

        <p>
            "Always calm and methodical, Marley took everything in his stride, and his role in the class was to look
            after "Gerald". Marley impressed me with his programming project. A version of Minesweeper that I was
            attempting to turn into Candy Crush, just for the hilarity of the voice effects. Marley never quite bought
            into "the vision". After all, his project was to secure an A level, not to provide his teacher with
            amusement! Of particular merit in the work was Marley's use of recursion. An advanced technique that most
            students shy away from, largely because most don't understand it, but that was the best way to solve the
            problem and Marley created some impressive code as a result.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Like a runner preparing for a marathon, Marley knew the race wasn't won in year 12. Over the course his
            determination grew, and he'd timed his studies to peak just at exams, just when it mattered the most.
            Congratulations Marley, "A" result, well deserved. Just remember, hashing tables are not about 119 101 101
            100!"
