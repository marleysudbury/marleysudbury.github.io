          1 (Dawe): Senator Collins, thanks for coming in.<br>
          2 (Clarke): It's a great pleasure, thank you.<br>
          1: This ship that was involved in the incident off western Australia this week,<br>
          2: Yeah, the one the front fell off?<br>
          1: Yeah.<br>
          2: Yeah, that's not very typical, I'd like to make that point.<br>
          1: Well, how is it untypical?<br>
          2: Well, there are a lot of these ships going around the world all the time, and very seldom does anything like this happen. I just don't want people thinking that tankers aren't safe.<br>
          1: Was this tanker safe?<br>
          2: Well, I was thinking more about the other ones.<br>
          1: The ones that are safe?<br>
          2: Yeah, the ones that the front doesn't fall off.<br>
          1: Well if this wasn't safe, why did it have eighty-thousand tonnes of oil on it?<br>
          2: Well, I'm not saying it wasn't safe, it's just perhaps not quite as safe as some of the other ones.<br>
          1: Why?<br>
          2: Well, some of them are built so the front doesn't fall of at all.<br>
          1: Wasn't this built so the front wouldn't fall off?<br>
          2: Well, obviously not.<br>
          1: How do you know?<br>
          2: Well, 'cause the front fell off, and twenty-thousand tonnes of crude oil spilled into the sea caught fire, it's a bit of a give away. I'd just like to make the point that that is not normal.<br>
          1: Well, what sort of standards are these oil tankers built to?<br>
          2: Oh, very rigorous, maritime engineering standards.<br>
          1: What sort of thing?<br>
          2: Well, the front's not supposed to fall off, for a start.<br>
          1: And what other things?<br>
          2: Well, there are regulations governing the materials that they can be made of.<br>
          1: What materials?<br>
          2: Well, cardboards out.<br>
          1: And?<br>
          2: No cardboard derivatives.<br>
          1: Like, paper?<br>
          2: No paper, no string, no cellotape.<br>
          1: Rubber?<br>
          2: No, rubbers out. They've got to have a steering wheel, there's a minimum crew requirement.<br>
          1: What's the minimum crew?<br>
          2: Oh, one I suppose.<br>
          1: So the allegations that they're just designed to carry as much oil as possible, and to hell with the consequences, I mean that's ludicrous is it?<br>
          2: Oh ludicrous! Absolutely ludicrous, these are very, very strong vessels.<br>
          1: So what happended to it in this case?<br>
          2: Well, the front fell off in this case by all means, but it's very unusual.<br>
          1: But, Senator Collins, why did the front fall off?<br>
          2: Well, a wave hit it.<br>
          1: A wave hit it?<br>
          2: A wave hit the ship.<br>
          1: Is that unusual?<br>
          2: Oh yeah, at sea? Chance in a million.<br>
          1: So what do you do to protect the environment in cases like this?<br>
          2: Well, the ship was towed outside the environment.<br>
          1: Into another environment?<br>
          2: No, no, no, it's been towed beyond the environment.<br>
          1: No, but from one environment into another environment.<br>
          2: No, it's beyond the environment, it's not in an environment, it's been towed beyond the environment.<br>
          1: It must be somewhere. Well, what's out there?<br>
          2: Nothing's out there.<br>
          1: Well, there must be something out there.<br>
          2: There is nothing out there. All there is is sea, and birds, and fish.<br>
          1: And?<br>
          2: And twenty-thousand tonnes of crude oil.<br>
          1: And what else?<br>
          2: And a fire.<br>
          1: And, anything else?<br>
          2: And the part of the ship that the front fell off, but there's nothing else out there.<br>
          1: Senator Collins, thank's for joining us.<br>
          2: It's a complete void.<br>
          1: Yeah, we're out of time.<br>
          2: The environment's perfectly safe. We're out of time?<br>
          1: Yeah.<br>
          2: Can you book me a cab?<br>
          1: But didn't you come in a Commonwealth car?<br>
          2: Yes, I did.<br>
          1: What happened?<br>
          2: Well, the front fell off.
