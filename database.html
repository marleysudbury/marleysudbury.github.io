		<p>Hello, my name is Marley Sudbury. This is a page I have written about databases. Becuase, say it with me now, I have no life.</p>
		
		<h3>Entity Relationship Diagram</h3>
		<p>An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a fundamental part of planning a relational database. This shows the various tables of the database and how they relate to each other. There are two types of relationship in a normalised relational database, one-to-one and one-to-many. Here is an example.</p>
		
		<p>Scenario: A man runs a company which puts tires on cars. He orders tires from suppliers, and has a list of customers and cars. Draw an entity relationship diagram (ERD) of a computer based system he could use.</p>

		<p>This shows quite clearly the relationship between the various fields in the tables. As you can see, each table has its own 'ID' field, which would be a primary key field (for those who don't know, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in a table). The ends of the line with 'crows feet' are the many end of the relationship, whilst the other ends have a '1' put through them. Also, note that the table names are singular, as this is an industry standard.</p>
		
		<p>Although most industry use of databases is done with network technology, such as SQL, for local solutions I find that Microsoft's <em>Access</em> is perfectly acceptable, as it is fully-featured, and hassle-free to set up. It is also free with my Office 365 account, provided by my school ;).</p>
