		<p>
			I, as what I would consider to be a functional member of society, feel that we spend far too much time pondering on the concept of "gender". It is not something that we can individually affect, and this is why. (By the way this all, like, totally my opinion man, and therefore obviously wrong.)
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I had an extensive conversation the other week about "are there more than two genders?": Well I have deduced that this entire notion is false. There are no definable number of genders! Yes, there are two biological sexes, that is to say you are either are born with XX (female) chromosomes or XY (male) chromosomes, apart from in exceptional circumstances. But that is not what gender is; it is all to do with the characteristics possessed by an individual, and how those traits are viewed by society, hence why gender is considered a "social construct", and not a biological trait.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			"But what if I don't possess traits that society considers to be masculine or feminine?" I can hear you crying! Well, not to worry, gender is not something that we can define as easily as we like to think. If you don't fit someone's notions of male or female or whatever, it really shouldn't matter. It is one of those many items which exists in the eye of the beholder (i.e. you cannot choose your own gender, it is something which anybody is free to interpret; you can only change what attributes you can change, e.g. hair length or clothing).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So, can you actually change your gender? Yes, somebody can change their traits (that is to say, physical attributes and behaviour), but it is not possible to change somebody's biological sex, as we have not yet developed the technology to change DNA; it should be considered that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a type of therapy which changes the characteristics of an individual (by changing the chemical balance of their body), but does not actually change their genetic make-up.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Essentially, most times people talk about gender they mean to say "sex", so I think that society still has a way to go in terms of knowledge possessed in the area, but I also think that a lot of people in the "LGBT" community take this to be some sort of opinion based issue, instead of the delicate social science it is in reality.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<em>Try as they might, Tumblrinas will never be successful in <a href="https://ageofshitlords.com/list-of-all-tumblr-genders-so-far">documenting all the genders under the sun</a>, as gender is one of those human traits which differ between each individual. That is, no body is the same gender as anybody else, because that's not how it works.</em>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			What is meant by non-binary (in the context of gender, obviously)? Well, someone who is "non-binary" does not identify as male or female, and does not like to be addressed by gender-specific pronouns, i.e. they prefer "they" over "he" or "she". This is silly, because as I have already said, gender is in the eye of the beholder. You do not get to <em>choose</em> your pronouns, that is the job of society.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			What about sexuality? Well, people often describe human sexuality as one of our most complex features, but in reality it is quite simple; it is to do with attraction to attributes, and what does that tie into? That's right! Gender, hence the apparent complexity of sexuality. Everything is confusing, and it all ties together into the mess that is humanity. In essence, you do you, and let's never talk about this again, thanks.
