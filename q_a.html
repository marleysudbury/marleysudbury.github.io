				<td>Will 'e-books' kill of printed books?</td>
				<td>I doubt it. There is very little sentiment attached to e-books, they are less practical (as you need electricity to use them), and you cannot buy second hand e-books, or lend one to a friend. And they're shit, and my arguments have run out. Oh well!
			</tr>

					glanced at my watch and noticed two things: it was 3
					minutes past 8, what I had just seen through the window was
					written on my watch. What had I seen?"
				</td>
				<td>
					The moon. The watch is digital, so the time is 20:03, which
					looks like M O O N when rotated 90 degrees
					counter-clockwise. P.S. credit to GCHQ, I can't come up
					with something that clever on my own.
