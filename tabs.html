		<h1>Tabs or spaces?</h1>
		
		<p>FUCK OFF!</p>
		
		<p>
			I was recently writing some programs in the Processing IDE, and I noticed something very odd. When I typed a tab, a tab character was inserted (as one might expect), but when the IDE automatically indented, it put in four spaces. I have spent more than enough time searching through 'preferences.txt' and I haven't yet found any resolution for this. Maybe my version is broken? Anyway, here is why tabs are ALWAYS, without any doubt, better than spaces.

			It is important for me to point out that my life leads me to only edit my own code, and if I were to need to, for whatever reason, modify code that was indented with spaces, I would stick to that so that the compiler doesn't get spooked. Perhaps it is irrational, but it makes me feel physically ill to have to use spaces.

			A tab is a whitespace character, larger than a space, though with no defined width. Most IDEs put a tab at 4 regular characters wide, while many browsers default to 8. Take a look at the following code:
		</p>
		
<pre>
if (x == True) {
print("X is true!")
} else {
print("X is false!")
}
</pre>
		
		<p>
			Because of the lack of indentation, it is hard to tell the structure of the program. This is why we need indentation in the first place, because otherwise it is to hard to figure out what goes where. Now, it doesn't really matter if you use tabs or spaces, but it does matter that you're consistant, which I shall now argue is easier with tabs than spaces.
		</p>

			If you are doing, as I often like to do, manual indentation, it is much easier to get right when you just have to press the indent key once. You can see very clearly if you miss one, or have to many. Another advantage of the tab is that its width can be adjusted in preferences, while the width of a space cannot. Most people have a preference to the width of indentation, usually either 4 or 2. However, if you're using tabs, this is neither here to there, as each person sees them as being exactly as wide as they wish them to be. Yet another advantage is that the tab is much more easily navigated than the spaces. This is because pressing the left arrow once is enough to travel the width of one indent, compared to four for the spaces, or however wide your indents are. Also, if you're using spaces, and you copy a section of code by someone who uses a different number of spaces, you have yourself a mess to tidy up, whereas code with tabs into code with tabs never goes wrong&hellip;

			In truth, I am only ever annoyed by tabs vs. spaces when I am the one using them. If I note their use elsewhere, it is merely as a curiosity, as when somebody uses grammar differently to how I would use it.
