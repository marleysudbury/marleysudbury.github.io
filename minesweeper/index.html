            Minesweeper is one of my favourite games. It has the perfect level
            of challenge which tickles my brain. Therefore, when I had to pick
            a game to recreate for my A level Computer Science coursework, it
            was a natural choice. Since then, I have remade the game in Pygame
            and Godot.

            I developed my first Minesweeper clone in a game engine called <a
                href="https://blitzresearch.itch.io/monkeyx">Monkey X</a>, on
            the advice of my Computer Science teacher. It was a fun process,
            but the engine had limitations which prevented me from achieving my
            full vision.

        <p>
            In gameplay and aesthetics, it is inspired by the version of
            Minesweeper I grew up playing on Windows XP, but I gave it music,
            sound effects and a fairly brief <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marleysudbury/minesweeper-monkeyx/refs/heads/master/Release/data/storyS.png">"story"</a>.

            About a year after finishing the first Minesweeper clone, whilst
            back at home after my first year at university, I decided to remake
            it in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> using the <a
                     href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> library.  All of
            the assets were carried over from the MonkeyX version, and most of
            the code structure was the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            This version has several improvements over the original. It is in
            Python, a widely understood language, the leaderboard function
            works correctly, and it works on different operating systems.
            However, some game modes which were in the MonkeyX version have not
            yet been implemented. Information about features and bugs can be
            found on <a href="https://github.com/marleysudbury/minesweeper-pygame/issues">the GitHub issues page</a>.

        <p>
            In 2024, I found out about the free and open-source game engine <a
                href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>. After playing around
            with it for a while, I decided to remake Minesweeper in it. This
            time, I created an all new set of assets, including pixel art made
            in <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a> and music made
            in <a
            href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/garageband/id408709785">GarageBand</a>.

        <p>
            This game still has a lot of features missing, such as a
            leaderboard, a settings page, a timer and a mines-remaining
                counter. Information about features and bugs can be found on <a
